Our ultimate goal is to see yields increased and livelihoods improved.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith an increasing global population and diminishing availability of arable land and water, the demand for high-yielding, environmentally robust crops is extremely high. In both natural and cultivated conditions, plants frequently encounter stressful environmental conditions that adversely affect growth, development, and/or productivity. Among such environmental stresses, drought is the greatest worldwide environmental constraint for agriculture. It is estimated that drought can reduce crop yield by up to 60-70 percent in any particular year. Therefore the ability of plants to tolerate drought conditions is crucial for agricultural production. A drought-resistant crop has the advantage of not only guarding against loss of yield due to unfavourable weather, but also of potentially allowing successful farming in previously inhospitable environments and/or reducing the amount of irrigation and water resources required to sustain a crop over the growing season.",

The underlying technology uses proprietary Cognitive Science and deep physics algorithms and architectures. Users describe their expertise through an intuitive interface like a graphical mindmap model, called an Expert Model. Expert Models can be projected onto search engines to find, retrieve, monitor, organize and compare knowledge which describes or fills-in model descriptiveness through related content. Expert Models can be projected onto document collections to lift known knowledge patterns, rules and relationships contained in document content. Knowledge discoveries and collections can be shared through an Export / Import function. A Knowledge Workbench GUI is provided for creating, refining, analyzing, understanding and comparing knowledge model conformance. An SDK is provided for creating purpose-built applications with minimal interface and embedded device integration while providing powerful, sophisticated knowledge automation processing in the background. An advanced architecture provides self-replicating, self-organizing, self-optimizing and self-describing processes which run concurrently in the background, in parallel, to break down complex content into simple patterns which map onto expectations models for understanding, analysis, prediction and optimal outcome resolution.",

We offer this service because there are many entrepreneurs that don't have the necessary technical skills to develop their own ideas. They either are too busy with their other business/job, don't have the capacity to go back to school to study computer science, or haven't been able to track down a Chief Technology Officer that is willing to give up what they are currently working on to join a new venture in an unproven concept. The entrepreneur(s) will then take they prototype to launch it to test it in the marketplace and validate whether they'd like to pursue their opportunity. We will provide marketing training during the development phase to show them how to acquire their first users and get traction.",

This relationship and the derived analytics can provide deep insights and improvements in a variety of applications that have been stagnant for years. \n\n\nOur team has been working in the field of remote sensing of movement for many years. In our trials, we have gained significant knowledge with specific regards to differentiating between types of locomotion and the classing of falls. These foundations are the starting line for further understanding and research into the recognition of gestures.\n\n\nThe key differentiation between our approach and existing technologies demonstrated by market leaders is that the paradigm system does not require users (targets) to wear or operate any device, be it a pendant, wristband or remote. \n\n\n\n\n\nThe technology we have developed as a baseline is suitable for a number of uses and can be adapted to be used in many environments taking advantage of a variety of types of wireless signal technologies. Great progress has already been made using ultrasound as a low-cost substitute for wireless detection, which we will use as the foundation for our proposed development work. \n\n\n\n\n\nTo complement this, we are exploring ways to better analyze return data derived from ubiquitous wireless signals in our environments (Signals of Opportunity, or SoO) to improve on issues that plague current ultrasound based systems such as coverage areas, accuracy and false alarms.",
